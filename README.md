# Asset Reliability

website: https://sellisd.github.io/reliability/

*Reliability* is the probability that a system will function as expected. Use the Weibull distribution to model the reliability as a function of time assuming that the cause of the failure does not change through the life-time of the system. If the cause of failure is not constant use the Gompertz distribution.
